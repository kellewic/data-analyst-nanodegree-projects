    "## 1. Gather data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will extract data using at least two different data gathering methods and combine the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.1.** Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "How does the streaming revolution compare to traditional theatrical releases in terms of financial performance, audience reception, and content characteristics, and how have these metrics evolved over time when accounting for inflation?\n",
    "\n",
    "The film industry has undergone a dramatic shift from theatrical dominance to streaming platforms, but how do these distribution channels compare in terms of content characteristics, audience engagement, and financial viability?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project merges TMDb theatrical movie data, IMDb ratings, four major streaming platform catalogs, and Federal Reserve CPI data to conduct a comprehensive analysis of streaming-exclusive versus theatrical releases. By adjusting all budgets and revenues to 2024 dollars using inflation data, I can fairly compare financial performance across six decades (1960-2024) and determine whether the \"streaming revolution\" represents truly different content or simply a new distribution channel for similar movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary data wrangling challenge involves fuzzy matching movies across datasets with inconsistent identifiers, requiring normalized title matching and year-based validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.2.** Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project combines four distinct data sources gathered using three different methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Dataset | Source | Method | Size | Primary Use |\n",
    "|---------|--------|--------|------|-------------|\n",
    "| TMDb Movies | Kaggle | Manual Download | 10K movies | Theatrical releases, financial data |\n",
    "| IMDb Ratings | IMDb Datasets | Programmatic Download | ~50K movies (filtered) | Additional ratings, metadata validation |\n",
    "| Streaming Platforms | Kaggle | Manual Download | ~22K titles | Streaming availability, exclusive content |\n",
    "| CPI Inflation Data | FRED API | API Access | 65 years (1960-2024) | Inflation adjustment for financial analysis |\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of these datasets enables analysis of streaming versus theatrical releases while ensuring fair financial comparisons across six decades."

    "#### TMDb Movies Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The TMDb (The Movie Database) dataset provides comprehensive information about 10,000 theatrical movies, representing the foundation of this analysis. This dataset is particularly valuable because it includes both original and inflation-adjusted financial figures (budget_adj and revenue_adj to 2010 dollars), extensive production metadata, and audience reception metrics. TMDb's community-driven model ensures broad coverage of theatrical releases while maintaining high data quality through active curation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Method: Manual download from Kaggle\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset variables:**\n",
    "- id (int) - TMDb unique identifier\n",
    "- imdb_id (string) - IMDb identifier for cross-dataset linking\n",
    "- popularity (float) - TMDb popularity score\n",
    "- budget (int) - Production budget in nominal dollars\n",
    "- revenue (int) - Total box office revenue in nominal dollars\n",
    "- original_title (string) - Original title\n",
    "- cast (string) - Cast members (pipe-delimited)\n",
    "- homepage (string) - Official movie homepage URL\n",
    "- director (string) - Director name\n",

    "- budget_adj (float) - Budget adjusted to 2010 dollars\n",
    "- revenue_adj (float) - Revenue adjusted to 2010 dollars\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this dataset:**\n",
    "TMDb serves as the core theatrical release dataset because it combines financial data (budget/revenue), audience reception (ratings/votes), production details (cast/director/companies), and content characteristics (genres/runtime) in a single source. The pre-existing inflation adjustment to 2010 demonstrates awareness of temporal comparison challenges, though this project will re-adjust all figures to 2024 dollars for consistency. The imdb_id field enables precise linking to IMDb data, while the comprehensive metadata supports fuzzy matching to streaming platforms where IDs are absent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Significance of variables:**\n",
    "- **id/imdb_id:** Primary keys for merging with IMDb and tracking across datasets\n",
    "- **budget/revenue (and _adj versions):** Core financial metrics for profitability analysis; will be re-adjusted to 2024 dollars\n",
    "- **vote_average/vote_count:** TMDb's rating system for comparison with IMDb's averageRating/numVotes\n",
    "- **genres/runtime:** Content characteristics for analyzing streaming vs theatrical patterns\n",
    "- **cast/director:** Enable talent crossover analysis between distribution channels\n",
    "- **release_year/release_date:** Temporal analysis and fuzzy matching keys\n",
    "- **popularity:** TMDb-specific engagement metric not available in other datasets"

    "IMDb provides free access to subsets of their data for non-commercial use, refreshed daily. This dataset extends the TMDb data with additional ratings and metadata, and provides validation for fuzzy matching when IMDb IDs are missing. IMDb's community-driven ratings represent a different audience demographic than TMDb, enabling comparison of rating systems.\n",

    "   - primaryTitle (string) - Popular title used in marketing\n",

The daily-updated nature ensures current data.\n",

    "- **startYear/runtimeMinutes:** Provide additional data points for movies missing this info in TMDb\n",

    "#### Streaming Platform Catalogs\n",
    "\n",
    "Four major streaming platform datasets provide comprehensive coverage of content available on Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Amazon Prime as of mid-2021. These datasets enable identification of streaming-exclusive content (never released theatrically) versus theatrical films later added to streaming platforms. The consistent schema across platforms facilitates comparison of content strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Datasets:**\n",
    "- Netflix: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows (~8K titles)\n",
    "- Hulu: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/hulu-movies-and-tv-shows (~3K titles)  \n",
    "- Disney+: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/disney-movies-and-tv-shows (~1.3K titles)\n",
    "- Amazon Prime: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/amazon-prime-movies-and-tv-shows (~10K titles)\n",
    "\n",
    "Type: CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "Method: Manual download from Kaggle (all four datasets)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shared Schema:**\n",
    "- show_id (string) - Unique identifier per platform\n",
    "- type (string) - \"Movie\" or \"TV Show\"\n",
    "- title (string) - Content title\n",
    "- director (string) - Director name(s)\n",
    "- cast (string) - Cast members (comma-separated)\n",
    "- country (string) - Production country\n",
    "- date_added (string) - Date added to platform (e.g., \"September 25, 2021\")\n",
    "- release_year (int) - Original release year\n",
    "- rating (string) - Content rating (PG-13, TV-MA, etc.)\n",
    "- duration (string) - Runtime (e.g., \"90 min\" or \"2 Seasons\")\n",
    "- listed_in (string) - Genres (comma-separated)\n",
    "- description (string) - Synopsis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why these datasets:**\n",
    "Streaming platforms represent the industry's future, but comprehensive availability data isn't accessible via APIs without commercial partnerships. These Kaggle datasets provide a snapshot of four major platforms' catalogs at a single point in time (2021), enabling analysis of platform content strategies. The lack of consistent identifiers (no TMDb/IMDb IDs) creates an authentic data wrangling challenge requiring fuzzy matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Significance of variables:**\n",
    "- **type:** Filters to movies only (excluding TV shows)\n",
    "- **title/release_year:** Primary keys for fuzzy matching to theatrical databases\n",
    "- **director/cast:** Enable cross-validation of matches and analysis of talent migration to streaming\n",
    "- **date_added:** Indicates when content became available (may differ from release_year)\n",
    "- **listed_in:** Genre analysis comparing streaming vs theatrical content preferences\n",
    "- **duration:** Identifies potential data quality issues (TV shows mis-labeled as movies)"

    "The Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) provides historical Consumer Price Index data necessary for adjusting movie budgets and revenues to constant 2024 dollars. Without inflation adjustment, comparing a 1970s film budget to a 2020s budget is meaningless. The CPI-U (Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers) is the standard measure used by economists for this purpose.\n",

    "**Why this dataset:**\n",
    "Inflation has been substantial over the 65-year span of this analysis (1960-2024). A \\\\$1 million budget in 1960 equals approximately \\\\$10.4 million in 2024 dollars. Without adjustment, financial analysis would be dominated by recency bias, making modern films appear far more expensive than historical films when they may actually be comparable in real terms. The FRED API provides authoritative, regularly-updated data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n",

    "**Significance of variables:**\n",
    "- **year/cpi:** Used to calculate inflation multiplier: `adjusted_amount = original * (CPI_2024 / CPI_year)`\n",

    "Before cleaning and merging the datasets, we must identify data quality and tidiness issues that could impact our analysis. This assessment phase follows a structured approach: each issue is evaluated both visually (inspecting sample data) and programmatically (using pandas methods to quantify the problem), with clear justifications for why each issue matters for our research questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section documents the four most critical issues—two quality problems and two tidiness violations—that must be resolved before proceeding with the streaming vs theatrical analysis. Quality issues relate to the accuracy, completeness, and validity of individual data values (missing identifiers, incorrect null encodings, zero-value anomalies). Tidiness issues concern the structural organization of data (observational units split across tables, multiple values stored in single columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "While these four issues represent the most significant barriers to analysis, additional data quality concerns will be identified and addressed during the cleaning phase. These include filtering datasets to relevant records (movies only, excluding TV shows), standardizing column names and data types, handling delimiter inconsistencies across platforms, and selecting the subset of variables needed for our specific research questions. The comprehensive cleaning strategy will be detailed in Section 3.\n",

    "- **Visual assessment:** Display sample data using `.head()`, `.sample()`, or filtered subsets to observe patterns\n",
    "- **Programmatic assessment:** Use pandas methods (`.isna()`, `.sum()`, `.duplicated()`, `.value_counts()`) to quantify issues\n",
    "- **Justification:** Explain why each issue impacts the analysis and which data quality/tidiness principle it violates"

    "This encoding causes several data quality problems: (1) columns that should be numeric (like `runtimeMinutes` and `startYear`) are interpreted as object/string types due to the presence of '\\N' text, preventing mathematical operations; (2) standard pandas null-handling methods like `isna()` and `fillna()` do not recognize '\\N' as missing data; (3) these pseudo-nulls skew data type detection and require special handling in all analytical operations.\n",

    "This is a validity issue that must be corrected by converting '\\N' strings to proper pandas null values (np.nan or None) before any numeric operations, type conversions, or null-value analysis can be performed reliably.

    "1. **Exceptional agreement:** 96.8% exact matches validates both sources\n",

    "4. **Minor discrepancies explained:** 298 movies (3.2%) differ by 1 year, likely due to:\n",
